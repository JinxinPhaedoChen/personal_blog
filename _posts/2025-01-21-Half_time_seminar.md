title:  Half-time done âœ…!
---

I'm very happy to finish my half-time seminar during which I get a lot of feedbacks and new inspiration from everyone ðŸ‘‚.
Thanks everyone for joining!

Extremely grateful for my half-time committee members ðŸ’¬: [Johan Elf](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Elf_(biolog)), [Mats Nilsson](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/mats-nilsson/) and [Bennie Lemmens](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/bennie-lemmens/).

Also happy to have all my (co-)supervisors (Magda Bienko, Vicente Pelechano and Goncalo Castelo Branco) joining.
