I am currently a PhD student working on Biophysics and Genome biology at [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/) and [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/). I graduated with a B.S. in chemistry at [West China Hospital](https://www.wchscu.cn/Home.html), [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/) in June 2021 and finished my undergrad thesis under the supervision of [Xiaoliang Sunney Xie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaoliang_Sunney_Xie) at [BIOPIC](https://biopic.pku.edu.cn/en/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).
